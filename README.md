# ENPH 253 Treasure Finding Robot

Through the course of summer 2022, our team (Spencer Bradbury, Tyler Wilson, Liza Belskiy, Ethan Predinchuck) worked tirelessly to create an autonomous robot from scratch to complete a challenging course.
The robot was required to follow tape lines, and IR beacons, cross chicken wire bridges, and navigate a narrow archway all while detecting and collecting Idols.
